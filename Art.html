                    <p class="">This sound wave project was consisted of wood,paint,and paint strips.The sound waves project was kind of hard because you had to trace your sound waves off the paper, then yoy had to trace the waves onto the wood board.Once the waves was printed on the wood you have to neatly paint the lines with a specific color scheme and my colors were white and red in order to express my feelings between love and hate.</p>
